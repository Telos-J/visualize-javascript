A platform for learning JavaScript with visualizations when the code is run. Traditionally, most of us learned how to code based on the console with text and numbers. However I find it more fun and easy to understand when the result is displayed visually. There are 7 chapters from console.log to objects each containing excercises that you can do and observe the outcome yourself.
